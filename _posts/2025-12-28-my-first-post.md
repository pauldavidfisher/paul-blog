Welcome to my first blog post on my new So Simple site!

## Getting Started

I've just finished setting up my Jekyll site using the So Simple theme. Here's what I've learned so far:

- How Jekyll works
- How to customize themes
- How to create posts and pages
- How navigation works with data files

## What's Next?

I'm excited to continue learning and customizing my site. Some things I want to explore:

1. Adding custom styles
2. Creating more content
3. Maybe deploying to GitHub Pages

This is just the beginning!
